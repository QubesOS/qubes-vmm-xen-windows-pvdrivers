1. Download and install the Windows Driver Framework SDK (6000, not 6001 which is Longhorn only) from Microsoft. You have to jump through a few hoops to get it, but it is free (as in beer of course. Microsoft don't do the 'as in speech' variety of free). It's also huge. http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/driver/wdf/default.mspx is a good place to start.

2. Start the WDF Build Environment that best suits your needs. I've only ever used 2003 32 Bit Checked.

3. Use Mercurial (get it from http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/index.cgi/BinaryPackages) to get the latest sources from http://xenbits.xensource.com/ext/win-pvdrivers.hg.

4. Go into each of xenpci, xenvbd, xennet, and xenhide and do a 'BLD'.

5. Assuming all went well, your drivers should be in toplevel target/i386
directory.

I've probably omitted some vitally important step from the above, so please let me know if you need any assistance compiling.

See the INSTALLING.txt file for information on how to install.
