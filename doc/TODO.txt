The source code still needs a tidy up. The Windows DDK stuff has it's 
own coding style which I've imitated in places, and then xen has it's 
own too, so this code is mostly one, the other, both, or neither. I'll 
get to that as soon as I figure out what coding style to use and where.

Known problems or things that need doing to make it properly useful:
. No power management
. Almost certainly won't support migration or suspend/resume.
. Not enough testing under SMP.
. Probably lots of other things too.

TODO:
. Do some performance testing
. virtual scsi (eg a front end for the scsi passthrough stuff)
. balloon drivers (this should actually be pretty easy)
. Write an installer for the above binaries to automate everything
. Fix BSoD crash dump under vbd (currently just hangs without writing
  a dump file)
. Correctly handle CD changes
