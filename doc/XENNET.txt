Advanced options on XenNet network adapter:

Check checksum on RX packets:
If enabled (and if Checksum Offload is enabled), xennet will check the checksum on incoming packets and report to Windows via the offload function. This is for compliance with the WHQL ndistest app but reduces performance. It can be safely disabled.

Checksum Offload:
Enables RX and TX checksum offload

Large Send Offload:
Sets the maximum size of TCP packets to be offloaded, or disables the offloading altogether.

Locally Administered Address
Overrides the MAC address of the adapter

MTU
Sets the maximum packet size reported to Windows

Scatter/Gather
Reports to Dom0 that sg is supported. I'm not sure exactly what the outcome if changing this will be...
