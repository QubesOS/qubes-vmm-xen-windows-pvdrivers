1. Download and install the Windows Driver Framework SDK (7600.16385.0
is what i'm using) from Microsoft. You have to jump through a few
hoops to get it, but it is free (as in beer of course. Microsoft don't
do the 'as in speech' variety of free). It's also huge.
http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/driver/wdf/default.mspx is a good place
to start.
http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/DevTools/WDK/WDKpkg.mspx is probably a
better place to start. 

2. Download and install the Wix Installer from
http://wix.sourceforge.net/ - i'm using 3.0 but newer might work.

3. Use Mercurial (get it from 
http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/index.cgi/BinaryPackages) to get 
the latest sources from 
http://xenbits.xensource.com/ext/win-pvdrivers.hg.

4. From the top directory, type 'makedist', which will build the drivers
for all architectures. If the build fails, then you probably don't have
exactly the 7600.16385.0 that i'm using. Edit set_ddk_path.bat and do a
'makedist' again.

5. Assuming all went well, your drivers should be in target/<os>/<arch> 
directory. (<os> is win2k, winxp, winnet and winlh, arch is i386 and
amd64). "gplpv_<platform>_<version>.msi" should also be created which is
the wix installer. The msi files with _debug in the filename are the
debug build versions.

See the INSTALLING.txt file for information on how to install.
