This driver is buildable using MinGW32. This may be preferable due to licensing
reasons to using the Microsoft WDK/DDK.

These instructions are for building the driver on a Linux Ubuntu system, using
the mingw32msvc cross-compiler.

1. sudo apt-get install mingw mingw-binutils mingw-runtime

2. mingw-runtime headers need to be modified. Download the latest w32api-src.tar.gz
   package from mingw.sf.net.

3. Untar, then edit lib/ddk/ntoskrnl.def. Remove ";" from line ~545, which says
   "KeNumberProcessors DATA". Add a line "KeFlushQueuedDpcs@0"

4. Type: "./configure i586-mingw32-msvc;make"

2. Use Mercurial and type:
   "hg clone http://xenbits.xensource.com/ext/win-pvdrivers.hg"

4. Change to the win-pvdrivers.hg/xenpci dir.

5. Modify the W32API_PATH at the top of makefile.mingw to point to the lib/ddk
   directory of the w32api package compiled above.

6. Type: "make -f makefile.mingw"

7. Building the shutdown monitor is not supported (maybe using Mono is an option
   here?)

8. This is still an extremely alpha build method, so this will give you a
   .sys file but you're on your own for the rest!
