This driver is buildable using MinGW32. This may be preferable due to licensing
reasons to using the Microsoft WDK/DDK.

These instructions are for building the driver on a Linux Ubuntu system, using
the mingw32msvc cross-compiler.

1. sudo apt-get install mingw32 mingw32-binutils mingw32-runtime

2. mingw-runtime headers need to be modified. Download the latest w32api-src.tar.gz
   package from mingw.sf.net.

3. Untar to a directory.

4. Use Mercurial and type:
   "hg clone http://xenbits.xensource.com/ext/win-pvdrivers.hg"

5. Apply the patch "w32api.diff" in the mingw directory to the untarred w32api
   source: "cd w32api-<version>;patch -p1 < ~/hg/win-pvdrivers.hg/mingw/w32api.diff"

6. Type: "./configure i586-mingw32msvc;make"

7. Change to the win-pvdrivers.hg/xenpci dir.

8. Modify the W32API_PATH at the top of makefile.mingw to point to the lib/ddk
   directory of the w32api package compiled above.

9. Type: "make -f makefile.mingw"

10. Building the shutdown monitor is not supported (maybe using Mono is an option
   here?)

11. This is still an extremely alpha build method, so this will give you a
   .sys file but you're on your own for the rest!
