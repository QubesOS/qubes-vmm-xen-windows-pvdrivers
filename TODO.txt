The source code still needs a tidy up. The Windows DDK stuff has it's own coding style which I've imitated in places, and then xen has it's own too, so this code is mostly one, the other, both, or neither. I'll
get to that as soon as I figure out what coding style to use and where.

Known problems or things that need doing to make it properly useful:
. Test under envirnments other than 32-bit PAE Windows 2003. Almost certainly won't work under 64 bit
. Doesn't unload properly
. No power management
. Almost certainly won't support migration or suspend/resume.
. Probably really poor performance - no optimisation done at all yet.
. Probably lots of other things too.
. Put up a binary release so it can get some further testing
. Write an installer for the above binaries to automate everything

TODO:
. Do some performance testing
. Implement a nice shutdown so that 'xm shutdown domain' works (need a user space driver to do this)
. network adapters (vif) (Andy Grover is looking at this)
. virtual scsi (eg a front end for the scsi passthrough stuff)
. balloon drivers (this should actually be pretty easy)
