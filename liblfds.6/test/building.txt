building test
=============

Windows (user-mode)
===================
1. Use Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 or Visual C++ 2008 Express Edition
   to load "test.sln".

2. Use Microsoft Windows SDK and GNUmake to run makefile.windows (obviously
   you'll need to have run the appropriate vcvars*.bat first; you can build
   for both IA64, 64-bit and 32-bit - just run the correct vcvars batch file).

   Targets are "rel", "dbg" and "clean".  You need to clean between switching
   targets.

Windows (kernel)
================
No build supported, since this is a command line utility.

Linux
=====
Use GNUmake to run "makefile.linux".  Targets are "rel", "dbg" and
"clean".  You need to clean between switching targets.
