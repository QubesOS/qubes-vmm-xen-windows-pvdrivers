1) Create an IMG file with the sources:

./mksrcimg.sh

The resulting winpvsources.img file can be passed to a Windows-based HVM and build there.

2) Create an ISO containing built drivers and installer:

./mkinstalliso.sh

The resulting winpvdrivers.iso can be attached to a Windows HVM in order to install
the Qubes PV drivers.
